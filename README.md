Netflix-clone is a project made by following [Karl Hadwen's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_EEwGe-a9o&t=22745s&ab_channel=KarlHadwen), but implementing my own component pattern rather than Compound Components pattern used in the tutorial.

## Motivation

Tutorial was used mainly to get a sense of how Styled Components work on a bigger project, but all the component interaction and state logic was implemented differently due to the difference in component pattern. Some important features which were also learned or improved regarding web development are:

- Firebase authentication
- Styled Components
- Improved usage of React Context
- Organized folder/component hierarchy
- Custom hooks
- Deployment
